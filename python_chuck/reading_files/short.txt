MY WORK
I was never the best at school or academics, I’m just a super curious guy. My channel exists to share these ideas and theories that interest me. I spend a lot of time building software and electronics, but there’s also a lot more to it. I’ve been working on a video format to document the logic, reasoning, and problems encountered during the process of learning engineering. A combination of innovation and storytelling.
