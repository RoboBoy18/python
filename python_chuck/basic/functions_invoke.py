             Imagine there's no heaven
             It's easy if you try
             No hell below us
             Above us only sky
             Imagine all the people
             Living for today... Aha-ah...

             Imagine there's no countries
             It isn't hard to do
             Nothing to kill or die for
             And no religion, too
             Imagine all the people
             Living life in peace... You...""")
